        <h1>Data Modeling for Product Analytics: Understanding User Behavior Through Data</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Product analytics is at the heart of every successful digital product strategy. Whether you’re tracking how users engage with your app, identifying key touchpoints in the user journey, or figuring out which features lead to the highest retention rates, data-driven decisions are essential for building better products. But gathering the right data is just the first step—the real value comes from modeling that data in a way that turns it into actionable insights.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is where data modeling plays a crucial role. By organizing user data, purchase history, and event tracking into meaningful relationships, businesses can better understand how their users interact with products and what drives conversions, retention, and overall user satisfaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Example SQL Query:</h3>
        <pre><code>
SELECT 
    u.userID, 
    u.signUpDate, 
    p.productID, 
    p.purchaseDate, 
    e.eventType, 
    e.eventTime 
FROM 
    users u
JOIN 
    purchaseHistory p ON u.userID = p.userID
JOIN 
    userEvents e ON u.userID = e.userID
WHERE 
    e.eventTime >= p.purchaseDate;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            This query links the user data, purchase history, and event tracking tables using userID and ensures that only events that occurred after a purchase are analyzed. This kind of structured approach allows businesses to track how users behave after making a purchase, enabling them to measure user engagement with the product post-purchase.
        </p>

        <p>
            For business leaders, the insights gained from a well-designed data model lead to smarter product decisions. A properly modeled dataset helps answer questions like:
        </p>

        <p>
            - Which features are most frequently used by high-value customers?<br>
            - What behaviors predict when a user is likely to churn?<br>
            - How can we improve product adoption for new users?
        </p>
